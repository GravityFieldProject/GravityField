# Solar_System_Project

## Presentation

This project is a remake of the solar system and also an asteroid field. The goal of this project is to integrate the proper solar system calculations of vector field to make planets orbit around each other, using their real data.

## Solar system Features

Upon launch, you are shown the solar sytem scene where you can look around with the mouse and and keyboard and observe various planets throughout the solar system. There is also a button to hide or the vector field. The sun being the heaviest, it isn't very interesting to show the vector field since everything will point towards it, so in that case, you can uncheck "Sun Gravity" to show the vector field without the sun.

## Asteroid Field Features

On the top left hand corner of the solar system scene, there is a button to swicth scenes which will take you to the asteroid field. When going to that scene, a bunch of asteroids will appear and will roam around the scene, affected by the gravity of each other asteroid. The point of this scene is simply to look at the interactions between asteroids. They are given various mass and velocity and, upon contact with another, the lightest asteroids' weight will be absorbed by the heavier one, making it grow bigger, showing you how the formation of planets occur. 
You can move the AsteroidField Count slider and hit Reload Scene to have a new field of asteroids, with more or less of them depending on the slider.
Note: you might want to go back a bit when asteroids start to eat eachother because they can really get big.
